# ReactJS App - List of GitHub repositories ðŸ‘¾

#### This small application was made for study purposes.

This app simply fetch data from the GitHub API and shows a list of repositories from a organization.

In this application I used ReactJS with TypeScript, and made just three components, being App the root component, RepositoryList is the component that shows RepositoryItem (child component) for each repository that the API returned.
